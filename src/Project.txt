Introduction:

My name is Ujjwal Maity. Currently working in Apexon. I have 4 years of experience in Java.
My last company was Yes Securities there I developed OMINI which was a Stock broking applications. 

The primary goal of the project was to provide a platrom to user where user can buy/sell stocks,
can track stcok, can view his portfolio, can apply in ipo, can check all his acoount reports, etc.

I was responsible for creating the middleware and admin REST APIs
using Java, Spring Boot and Hibernate
for Login, Profile & Settings, Dahboard, Watchlist, Reports, Price Alert & Notification, Help & Support modules.

We are using Microservice architecture, MongoDB & PostgreSQL for database,
Redis for caching, JWT for authentication, Git to collaborate with my team mates.
I integrated third-party REST APIs, SMS & Email sending service. 

This project enhanced my experience in microservices architecture.

Difficulty:

- Performance issue because of multiple request at a same time
- We use redis to cache data,
    so that every query does not goes to db,
    it fetch data from Redis.
    It helps to improve performance.
